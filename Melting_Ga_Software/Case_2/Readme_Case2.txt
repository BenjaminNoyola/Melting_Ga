******************************* CASE 2 *****************************************

For a complete documentation about the Melting_Ga software, please visit 
https://suemirodriguezromo.org/recursos/

Run these examples, recall than Anaconda must be installed, 

1) First try (I assume that the working dir is the repository dir):

-  export PATH=/home/user/anaconda2/bin:$PATH

2) You could change the parameters and the domain size 

3) in a terminal or anaconda prompt type: $ python program_name.py

4) Compare with analitical solution running: python an_vs_num_grafico.py


This software has 2 implementation.

Software 1: has homogeneous porosity in all domain

Sofware 2: The porosity is obtained from an image. This code provides the 
image tratment and calculation of a local domain. The user could change the image.
